# Getting the data

1. create a Kaggle account: https://www.kaggle.com/
2. get API keys and user name
   - Go to your account, and click on your profile in the top right
   - Then click on "Settings"
   - Scroll down to the API section and click on "Create New Token"
   - Get your username and API key from there

We have written a data loader function for you in the "nba/data_loader.py".This allows you to
download the data with by running the script from the terminal. Run the following command in the
terminal being at the root of the repository.

```bash
python nba/data_loader.py -u "your_user_name" -k "your_api_key" -d "wyattowalsh/basketball"
```

Replace "your_user_name" and "your_api_key" with your username and API key. This creates a json
file at "~/.kaggle/kaggle.json" with your username and API key, which is used to authenticate your
account and download the data.
